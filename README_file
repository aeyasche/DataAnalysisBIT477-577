BIT477/577: DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT
TITLE: Comparison of Deblur and DADA2 on 16S rRNA sequencing data

This directory contains the files and scripts used to process and analyze 16S marten paired-end sequences. 
Two LSF batch scripts were written, with each using a different denoising program through QIIME, so that
these jobs can be resubmitted to the HPC for reproducibility and code tracking. 

Denoising programs used were Deblur and DADA2. The goal of this project was to compare and contrast the 
results of these two program to see if they introduce any bias in the diversity metric results and if so, 
what type of bias. This project is aimed towards deducing the differences between Deblur and DADA2 to 
help future researchers determine which program they should use based on their dataset.

DIFFERENCES AT A GLANCE:
Deblur - uses sub-OTU method. Requires read joining on paired end reads.
DADA2 - uses ASV method. Does read joining itself within the program.
